# Vapour-Compression-Refrigeration-System-4E-Analysis
4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environmental) performance analysis and optimization of a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System (VCRS) using R134a, R744, and R410a refrigerants.

# Project Overview
This project provides a **4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environmental)** analysis of a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System. 
The study evaluates **R134a, R744, and R410a** as zero-ODP alternatives to traditional refrigerants using a computational model.

**Energy:** Evaluates the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** by analyzing refrigerating effect versus compressor.

**Exergy:** Quantifies **Exergy Destruction ($E_d$)** and **Exergetic Efficiency ($\eta_{ex}$)** to identify system irreversibilities.

**Economic:** Assesses the cost-viability of substituting refrigerants based on thermodynamic performance.

**Environmental:** Compares **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** and **Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)** across the tested fluids.
