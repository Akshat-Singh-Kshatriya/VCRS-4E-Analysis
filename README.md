# Vapour-Compression-Refrigeration-System-4E-Analysis
4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environmental) performance analysis and optimization of a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System (VCRS) using R404A, R407C, and R410A refrigerants.

# Project Overview
This project provides a **4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environmental)** analysis of a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System. 
The study evaluates **R404A, R407C, and R410A** as zero-ODP alternatives to traditional refrigerants using a computational model.

**Energy:** Evaluates the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** by analyzing refrigerating effect versus compressor.

**Exergy:** Quantifies **Exergy Destruction ($E_d$)** and **Exergetic Efficiency ($\eta_{ex}$)** to identify system irreversibilities.

**Economic:** Assesses the cost-viability of substituting refrigerants based on thermodynamic performance.

**Environmental:** Compares **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** and **Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)** across the tested fluids.

# Future Work & Contribution
**Future Work:** Integration of natural refrigerants (R290, CO2), nano-lubricant thermal modeling, and Multi-Objective Optimization for system-level efficiency.

**Contributions:** Contributions are welcome. Please fork this repository and submit a pull request.
